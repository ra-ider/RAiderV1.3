            Some of the diseases like gout, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis,
            lupus, viral arthritis, reactive arthritis, palindromic rheumatism
            etc. might be mistaken as rheumatoid arthritis. Hence it is
            important to get the right diagnosis at the right time for better
            treatment outcomes.

          <p>
            There is a genetic component that increases the risk of getting the
            disease. Although, relatives of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis
            have a slightly higher risk of getting the disease, it cannot be
            classed as a hereditary disease, since the vast majority of patients
            have no first degree affected individuals.

            First of all, ensure you do NOT ignore in case you have any
            symptoms. Ensure you do NOT skip treatment, overdo any activities,
            or increase inflammatory mediators via smoking, stressing, or pro-
            inflammatory diet. Stay away from quacks, a sedentary lifestyle, and
            any sort of negativity or pessimism. Ensure oroodental hygiene and
            stay as much hydrated as possible.

            Certain food items and additives that tend to increase inflammation
            such as sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, omega-6 fatty acids,
            refined carbohydrates, monosodium glutamate, gluten, aspartame,
            alcohol, cigarettes etc.

            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            Stress tends to make RA symptoms worse. People with post-traumatic
            stress disorder (PTSD) have a higher risk of developing RA and other
            autoimmune diseases. People who have experienced childhood trauma
            were more likely to have rheumatic diseases.

            Multiple studies have reported autoantibodies in patients with
            COVID-19, particularly anti-cardiolipin, anti-Î²2-glycoprotein I and
            antinuclear antibodies. 1 2 Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies
            (ACPA) and flaring of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after SARS-Cov-2
            infection have also been described.

          <p>
            Smoking is a risk factor for RA, especially RF-positive RA in men
            and heavy smokers. For women, the risk for smokers is about
            1.3-times greater than for non-smokers. Lifelong cigarette smoking
            was positively associated with the risk of RA, even among smokers
            with a low lifelong exposure.

            <span>Can RA affect more than just joints?</span>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, RA is not always just limited to joints. Some
            patients can have involvement of other parts of the body, including
            skin, eyes, heart, lungs, nerves, blood and blood vessels. Often,
            these findings are in patients with more severe joint involvement,
            but it reinforces the need to treat RA.

          <p>
            Some of the points that might help you if you are having a bad day
            as an rheumatoid arthritis patient are-to meditate, as it makes you
            more self aware. Mild exercise improves flexibility and helps you
            become more active. Be grateful, looking for the best in every
            situation. Do not be afraid of seeking help and support in the very
            first place. Visit your doctor regularly and do not hesitate in
            making the recommended changes.

            <span>Can obesity be a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis?</span>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            Obesity is a controversial risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis
            (RA). A link between obesity and RA is plausible, since biologic
            mechanisms of inflammation are present in adipose tissue, and these
            may be linked to chronic systemic inflammation.

          <p>
            Flares that are intense or last a long time. Diagnosis at a young
            age, which means the disease has more time to become active in your
            body. Rheumatoid nodules -- bumps under your skin, often around your
            elbows. Active inflammation that shows up in tests of joint fluid or
            blood.

            <span>Can losing weight help RA patients?</span>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            Losing weight can take stress off of arthritic joints. It's also
            been shown that a lower BMI can reduce RA risk. Adults with RA who
            are obese often become disabled more quickly than people with RA who
            have a healthier weight. This paradox can be difficult for people
            living with RA and other similar painful conditions.

        <div class="question">

            <span>Can RA cause sleep problems?</span>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            While the exact percentage of RA patients who experience sleep
            problems is hard to nail down, more than 80% of people with RA
            report fatigue as part of their symptoms. Sleep problems can
            increase levels of stress hormones and aggravate flares.

            <span>Can RA cause dementia?</span>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            Due to inflammation, the blood supply to vital organs like brain
            might reduce, leading to increased risk of dementia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <button>
            <span>Is there a blood test which can confirm the diagnosis?</span>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
          </button>
          <p>
            There are a number of blood tests which can be and are performed by
            your rheumatologist to help make the diagnosis of RA. They may look
            for signs of inflammation, or antibodies which can be associated
            with RA. However, these tests do not diagnose RA. Many patients are
            diagnosed with RA with completely normal blood tests. RA is
            diagnosed based on your medical history and physical exam findings.
