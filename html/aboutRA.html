        We believe talking helps and so does a Harvard study, almost 80 years
        old, has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be
        happier. According to Robert Waldinger, director of the study, a
        psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of
        Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, “ Taking care of your body is
        important, but tending to your relationships is a form of self-care too.
        That, I think, is the revelation.” Taking Inspiration from the study we
        decided to create a community network where various RA warriors from
        different geography and background can come to a common platform to
        share their story and form a community where everybody feels heard.
