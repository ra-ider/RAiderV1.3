        <div class="looking-after-description">Progressive muscle relaxation is a form of therapy that involves tightening and relaxing your muscle groups, one at a time, in a specific pattern.
The goal is to release tension from your muscles, while helping you recognize what that tension feels like.</div>

        <div class="looking-after-description">Constant worrying can take a heavy toll. It can keep you up at night and make you tense and edgy during the day.
